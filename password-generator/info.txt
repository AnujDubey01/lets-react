1️⃣ Importing React Hooks

import { useState, useCallback, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

What this line does->
We are importing React Hooks that allow us to:
* store data
* run logic automatically
* optimize performance
* access DOM elements

Why hooks are needed

React functional components do not have memory by default.
Hooks give them state, lifecycle, and references.


2️⃣ Component Starts
function App() 
Meaning

* App is a functional component
* React runs this function to generate UI
* Every state change causes this function to re-run


3️⃣ useState – Component Memory
3.1 Password Length State
const [length, setLength] = useState(8)
length → current password length
setLength() → updates length

3.2 Allow Numbers State
const [numberAllowed, setNumberAllowed] = useState(false)
Default → false

3.3 Allow Special Characters State
const [charAllowed, setCharAllowed] = useState(false)
Default → false

3.4 Generated Password State
const [password, setPassword] = useState("")
Stores the final generated password
Displayed in input field



4️⃣ useRef – Direct DOM Access
const passwordRef = useRef(null)

Purpose : ->

*Creates a reference to the password input field
*Used for selecting and copying text

Why not document.getElementById?

React prefers refs
Cleaner, safer, React-friendly



5️⃣ useCallback – Password Generator Function
const passwordGenerator = useCallback(() => {

Why useCallback?

Prevents function recreation on every render
Needed because this function is used inside useEffect

5.1 Base Character String
let pass = ""
let str = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

pass → final password
str → character pool

5.2 Add Numbers (Conditionally)
if (numberAllowed) str += "0123456789"
Adds digits if checkbox is checked

5.3 Add Special Characters
if (charAllowed) str += "!@#$%^&*-_+=[]{}~`"


Adds special characters if allowed

5.4 Random Password Generation Loop
for (let i = 1; i <= length; i++) {
  let char = Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length)
  pass += str.charAt(char)
}

How it works

Loop runs length times
Random index is selected
Character is appended to password

5.5 Update State
setPassword(pass)
Updates password state
Causes UI to re-render

5.6 Dependency Array
}, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed])


Function re-created only when these change

6️⃣ Copy to Clipboard Function
const copyPasswordToClipboard = useCallback(() => {

Purpose

Allows user to copy password with one click

6.1 Select Text
passwordRef.current?.select()
Selects full password text

6.2 Set Selection Range
passwordRef.current?.setSelectionRange(0, 999)
Ensures compatibility across devices

6.3 Copy to Clipboard
window.navigator.clipboard.writeText(password) ->
Copies password to system clipboard

6.4 Dependencies
}, [password])


Function updates only when password changes

7️⃣ useEffect – Automatic Password Generation
useEffect(() => {
  passwordGenerator()
}, [length, numberAllowed, charAllowed, passwordGenerator])

What this does :
Runs passwordGenerator automatically when:
length changes
numberAllowed changes
charAllowed changes

Why useEffect?

Because generating password is a side effect
